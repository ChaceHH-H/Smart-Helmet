# Smart Safety Helmet
## Overview
The smart safety helmet project aims to provide real-time health and environmental monitoring for miners. By integrating multiple sensors (including heart rate sensors, gas sensors, pressure sensors, and accelerometers), the helmet can monitor the miners' vital signs and the safety of the surrounding environment in real time, and issue an alarm when dangerous situations are detected. The project uses Arduino and Firebase for data processing and storage to ensure the timeliness and reliability of information.
